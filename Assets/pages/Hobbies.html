    <hr>
   <ul>
    <li>As a Star Wars enthusiast, I find joy in exploring the intricate universe, its characters, and the timeless battle between the light and dark sides.</li>
    <br>
    <li>My love for dogs extends beyond companionship; their loyalty and unconditional love inspire me every day.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Understanding code is more than a hobby for me; it’s a puzzle that fuels my curiosity and challenges my problem-solving skills.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Building with wood allows me to express my creativity and craftsmanship, transforming simple materials into something meaningful.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Hiking in nature is my escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, offering me a chance to reconnect with the earth and find peace in its beauty.</li>
   </ul>
